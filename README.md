# Specto Art

Spector its like colors. Art is subjective.

# Mechanics
- [__Keys and Locks__](materials\scripts\key_lock\README.md) - A key opens a corresponding lock, enabling interaction with "levers" across different levels or scenes.

- [__Combat and Collision Boxes__](materials/scripts/boxes/README.md) - Hitbox, hurtbox, parrybox, pushbox, similar to those used in fighting games.

# Systems
- [__Functions Library__](autoload/functions.gd) - Global utility functions for mathematics, pause management, screen effects, and geometry operations.

- [__Phantom Camera__](addons/phantom_camera) - Advanced camera system with 2D/3D support, multiple camera types, noise effects, and smooth transitions.

- [__Save System__](autoload/saver/README.md) - Comprehensive game state persistence with automatic node tracking, manual checkpoints, and file-based save/load operations.

- [__Buffer System__](addons/buff_er/README.md) - Input buffering and action timing management for responsive player controls (coyote jump, input buffering, etc.).

- [__Dynamic Expression__](materials/scripts/dynamic_expression/README.md) - Flexible expression evaluation system for mathematical calculations, logical conditions, and property assignments with NodePath resolution.

- [__Input Monitor__](autoload/input_monitor/input_mointor.gd) - Device-aware input display system that automatically detects input devices (keyboard/gamepad) and provides localized button names and images for different platforms (xBox, PlayStation, Nintendo, PC).

# Objects

- [__Multichecker__](materials/scripts/multichecker/README.md) - Interactive multi-choice menu system with conditional options, integrated with key-lock mechanics and dynamic expressions for complex game interactions.
